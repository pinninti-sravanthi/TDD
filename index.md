What is testing?
> Software testing is an activity to check whether the actual results match the expected results and to ensure that the software system is Defect free. 

Why testing codes is so important?
- High quality product, will gain customer confidence
- Lower maintenance cost
- Reliable results


What is TDD ?
 
> Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: first the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards.
